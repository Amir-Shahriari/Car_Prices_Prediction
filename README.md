## Overview

The **Car Price Prediction** project explores a dataset containing information about cars to:

- Clean and preprocess data for better analysis and modeling.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between car features and prices.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction.
- Gain insights into the factors affecting car prices.

This project is ideal for beginners and intermediates interested in practical machine learning applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.


## Project Description

The **Car Price Prediction** notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze correlations between features and car prices.
   - Visualize data trends using scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Identify key features influencing car prices.
   - Provide actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and manufacturers.

### Applications

- Price estimation tools for car dealerships.
- Decision support for car buyers and sellers.
- Educational material for learning regression modeling and machine learning.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed in the notebook)


## How to Use

1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Car_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells step-by-step to execute the code and observe the outputs.

Each step includes detailed comments and explanations to guide you through the analysis and modeling process.
